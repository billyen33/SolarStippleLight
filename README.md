# Solar-Powered Stipple Light Display
This project was inspired by the venerable [@matth215](https://github.com/matth215)'s [Trichrome Stipple Light project](https://github.com/matth215/Trichrome-Stipple-Light), which was developed as a Stanford [lab64](https://lab64.stanford.edu/home) workshop.

## About
[Stippling](https://www.artistsnetwork.com/art-mediums/drawing/get-started-with-stippling/) and [pointillism](https://www.britannica.com/art/pointillism), are both art forms that use dots to create images (black/white and color, respectively), and they can be thought of as the original electronic display. This project borrows from the idea of overlapping dots of different primary colors to create full spectrum of colors in the viewer's eyes. However, instead of using paint, we leverage red, green, and blue LEDs with carefully laser-engraved points on three acrylic sheets to generate full-color images. A fourth acrylic sheet with black paint in the engraved cavities is used to emphasize shadows when the display is unlit. See the image below for a zoomed-in version of the stipple display:
